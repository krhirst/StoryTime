One day I was walking down the Hauptstrasse when I ran into a familiar face.
That face was no other than the very famous Mehlhase.
Not only was the face famous but so was the outfit. Nobody can pull off a pair of lederhosen like the famous Mehlhase.
No one can don a Dirndel to the heart of Berlin like the famous Mehlase.
Well sadly to find out that Mehlase was on her way to the flughafen, but a smile was cracked as she had left in her car,
while rocking out to Rammstein as that was the genre of musik she enjoyed.
This was the best music that was commonly listend to at the Schloss down the river.
Oftentimes the musik listening was paired with a delicious bratwurst to enjoy at the same time.
rumor has it that the best bratwurst were sold in secret at a baeckeri not too far from the schloss.
