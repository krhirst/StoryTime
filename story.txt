One day I was walking down the Hauptstrasse when I ran into a familiar face.
That face was no other than the very famous Mehlhase.
Not only was the face famous but so was the outfit. Nobody can pull off a pair of lederhosen like the famous Mehlhase.
No one can don a Dirndel to the heart of Berlin like the famous Mehlase.
